# Debate Flow

This is a Excel template and collection of macros meant to enhance the flowing
experience for debate.

## Installation

You can get a copy of the most recent template from the
[releases page](https://github.com/shreerammodi/debate-flow/releases). After
downloading it, simply open the file to make a new flow.

For convenience, you can go to the `File` menu and click `Save as template`,
ensuring to select the `.xltm` (macro-enabled template) filetype. This will
cause the flow template to be accessible in Excel's "new workbook" menu any time
you wish to create a new flow..

If you wish to use a Google Sheets version instead, you can access it at the
following link by making a copy.

> [!WARNING]
>
> The Google Sheets version of this flow template is not fully supported. Some
> features won't be exactly as they appear in Excel, and performance may be
> slower.

## Usage

The `Info` page of the template contains information for all macros and
keybindings provided.

You can move the downloaded template to your Excel templates folder, or
alternatively open a new Excel sheet based on the template in order to create a
new flow.
