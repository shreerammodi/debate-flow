//! Flush before a window closes or the app exits.
//!
//! Autosave debounces, so at any instant the newest edit may still be in
//! memory. Closing a window or quitting used to tear the process down
//! immediately, taking that edit with it - the one outcome the product exists
//! to prevent. Every close now runs through here instead: the frontend is
//! asked to write, and only then does the window actually close (or, for a
//! full quit, the process actually exit).
//!
//! Two shapes of attempt share one piece of state:
//!   - **Closing one window** claims just that window's label. Once it
//!     confirms (or times out), that window alone is destroyed.
//!   - **Quitting** (Cmd+Q, or closing the last open window) claims every
//!     open window's label at once. Exit only happens once every one of them
//!     has confirmed; one window reporting a failed write cancels the whole
//!     attempt; a lone timeout deadline covers the group.
//!
//! Either way, a claimed label is never released on success - there is
//! nothing left to release it for, since the window is about to be destroyed
//! or the whole process is about to exit, and the OS can synthesize another
//! close request for a window mid-teardown. Only a reported failure releases
//! a claim, because that is the one outcome that leaves the window(s) open
//! and needing to be closable again.
